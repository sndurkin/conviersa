--- TODO ---

Settings/Config
- add settings for fonts for input, output, and channel userlist
- add a SettingsWindow which allows the user to customize settings using a GUI

Output Control
- add links for hyperlinks and channels, and add double-click functionality for them
- add a right-click menu for each link type
  -> nicks
  -> channels
  -> hyperlinks
- add a WHOIS panel that pops up from the bottom of the OutputControl
- need some way to change the colors from threads outside the OutputControl.. since they are solely read from within the paintEvent function, they should be modified within the event loop
  -> QCoreApplication::postEvent()
  -> QTimer::singleShot()
  -> QMetaObject::invokeMethod() (with Qt::QueuedConnection)
  -> QObject::connect() (with Qt::QueuedConnection)
  -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3937152/looking-for-postmessage-functionality-in-qt
- test appending new lines to OutputControl
  -> if it's at the bottom line, control should scroll to next line when it's appended
  -> when the mouse is down, it should not scroll, even if at the bottom
- link events to add:
  -> clicked
  -> right-clicked
  -> middle-clicked
  -> hovered (tooltips)

Input Control
- need a way to add colors and other control codes to the text
- smart nick completion

Misc GUI
- add a ChannelOptionsPanel which provides things like modes, topic, bans list, etc for an op to modify
- enhance the ServerConnectionPanel to save servers recently connected to
  -> find a way to save 5 or so servers in the config file


Misc
- better implementation of IRC protocol (numerics)

Styles
- add selection color for a user in the channel's user list
- fix issue with rounded borders on OutputControl (and scrollbar)
- decide what to do about the background colors
- fix issue with window manager selection style in Win7



--- BUGS TO FIX ---

- when selecting text in the OutputControl and a new message arrives, it moves the screen which causing a disruption in the selection
- there's a weird bug when clicking on the OutputControl when it brings the entire client back to focus (highlights whatever was already highlighted previously)
- for Erroneous Nickname, don't let styles of nick carry into the rest of the msg
- bug when minimizing the client's main window, the title becomes "Conviersa" instead of "Conviersa - [currently open window]"
- add a "Connect cancelled" message to the output?
- when receiving a PM, the new QueryWindow is in focus, but not selected in the tree
  -> i don't like this entire process of tree selections at all... the fact that there's two functions, giveFocus() and focusedInTree(), doesn't
     make much sense, it should be cleaner
