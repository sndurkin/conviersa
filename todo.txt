ToDo: things to be implemented are basically separated based on the class or part of the project they belong in

Handle multi-line copy-pasting

IWindow
	- make sure there aren't any functions in IWindow that will cause a crash if m_pManager is NULL

IIrcWindow
	- get rid of the top empty line when an IIrcWindow is first printed to (or the bottom empty line when there’s a scrollbar)
		- this may have already been completed, i can't remember
	- add an option for automatically scrolling to the end of the document if it isn't already (and it's past some given time of inactivity)
		- or, at the very least, a notification that it isn't scrolled all the way to the bottom
	- multi-line support for the input control (m_pInput)
	- when text starts displaying in the output box, it starts at the bottom, not the top
	- CREATE CUSTOM OUTPUT CONTROL
		- specific features for this will be outlined later
	- add support for encodings, a little research will be needed for this

IrcStatusWindow
	- finish CTCP support
	- add the rest of the control codes functionality
	- make sure support for channel modes is completely finished
	- decide how to display NOTICEs and WALLOPS and fully implement that
	- add support for URL clicking
		- need to make it intelligent (in other words, it doesn't include trailing parentheses or periods or etc in addresses)
	- redo nickname comparisons
		- use insensitive comparison and make sure {}| and []\ are covered based on casemapping etc.

IrcChanListWindow
	- fix the bug with the QheaderView (resets the sizes when we re-add the view)
	- fix the painting for highlighting a channel; under vista it looks crappy and inconsistent
		- this will probably involve creating a custom view control for the channel list that is (hopefully) faster
	- running <10000 on freenode is extremely slow (also eats the crap out of memory)
		- maybe do some research, could make a custom view control that is lightweight and fast
	- maybe add a “Join Channel” button?

IrcDebugWindow
	- will be quite useful for development, i think i might work on this very soon
	- currently using a preprocessor define inside IrcStatusWindow called DEBUG_MESSAGES

POSSIBLE FEATURE (can be added to wiki later)
	- switching focus between windows with ctrl+tab (and possibly with a window dialog similar to Windows' alt+tab dialog)
