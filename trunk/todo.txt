--- TODO ---

Settings/Config
- add settings for fonts for input, output, and channel userlist
- add a SettingsWindow which allows the user to customize settings using a GUI
  -> need a search box which searches the titles and descriptions of each setting in the window

Output Control
- add alternative mode for selecting text where it doesn't immediately copy the text and it stays select after releasing the mouse
- need an option for turning text wrapping off, for DebugWindow (will just use a horizontal scrollbar)
- add a WHOIS panel that pops up from the bottom of the OutputControl
- add links for hyperlinks and channels, and add double-click functionality for them
- add a right-click menu for each link type:
  -> nicks
  -> channels
  -> hyperlinks
- link events to add:
  -> clicked
  -> right-clicked
  -> middle-clicked
  -> hovered (tooltips)

Input Control
- need a way to input control codes (ctrl+b for bold, ctrl+u for underline, ctrl+r for reverse, ctrl+k for color)
  -> need to have a better display for control codes than a rectangular box
- maybe the input box can grow dynamically depending on how many lines are currently being displayed
  -> and at some point it gets a scrollbar
  -> shift+enter or ctrl+enter would add a newline
- options for new display:
  1) behaves like a rich text editor, where you can change the style (bold, underline, reverse) and
     color and it is reflected as you use it (the only difficulty with this option is handling text selection)
  2) the text in the input box doesn't change style or color, and instead of black rectangular boxes to
     represent styles, they will be displayed by a box with a single letter inside of it (namely 'B' for bold,
     'U' for underline, etc)
- eventually need to add a toolbar so a user can access these features through the UI
- smart nick completion

Misc GUI
- add a ChannelOptionsPanel which provides things like modes, topic, bans list, etc for an op to modify
- enhance the ServerConnectionPanel to save servers recently connected to
  -> find a way to save 5 or so servers in the config file

Misc
- better implementation of IRC protocol (numerics)
- add a log file for errors, instead of outputting everything using qDebug()

Styles
- fix bug in Qt with scrollbar on OutputControl when borders are set
- look into bug in Qt with rounded borders on QListWidget



--- BUGS TO FIX ---

- when selecting text in the OutputControl and a new message arrives, it moves the screen which causing a disruption in the selection
- there's a weird bug when clicking on the OutputControl when it brings the entire client back to focus (highlights whatever was already highlighted previously)
- for Erroneous Nickname, don't let styles of nick carry into the rest of the msg
- bug when minimizing the client's main window, the title becomes "Conviersa" instead of "Conviersa - [currently open window]"
- bug when highlighting text which has a lot of consecutive spaces in it - something that needs further investigation
- add a "Connect cancelled" message to the output?
- when receiving a PM, the new QueryWindow is in focus, but not selected in the tree
  -> i don't like this entire process of tree selections at all... the fact that there's two functions, giveFocus() and focusedInTree(), doesn't
     make much sense, it should be cleaner
