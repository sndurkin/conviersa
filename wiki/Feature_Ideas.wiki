#summary list of features

= Feature Ideas =

We'll use this page to document any ideas for features we have. We can use a list format for now; if feature descriptions grow too large we can use something else.

  * search bar
    * similar to firefox's in that it searches while the user types
    * similar to chrome's in that it marks all the found results in the scrollbar (with small lines)
  * URL highlighting
    * links also need to be clickable, obviously
  * nick highlighting
    * nicknames can be assigned random colors, and then they will also be highlighted when someone uses their name in chat
  * smart tabbing
    * it basically assigns higher precedence to nicks that have spoken recently, so when performing nick completion with the tab button, you're more likely to get a nickname that you want; after the precedence, it is still ordered alphabetically
    * I'd also prefer an option for old-school tabbing, which is the way all other clients are now (just alphabetically)
