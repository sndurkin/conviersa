#summary list of features

= Feature Ideas =

We'll use this page to document any ideas for features we have. We can use a list format for now; if feature descriptions grow too large we can use something else.

  * search bar
    * similar to firefox's in that it searches while the user types
    * similar to chrome's in that it marks all the found results in the scrollbar (with small lines)
  * URL highlighting
    * links also need to be clickable, obviously
  * nick highlighting
    * nicknames can be assigned random colors, and then they will also be highlighted when someone uses their name in chat
